Props and state menagement
================================
state means data: 

note:
By default, when ever rendered data is updated, react js component is not reloaded / rendered with new changes

solution: use state or new props to render the component for each update 


Props: used to pass data from parent component to child component
to pass/send data back to parent from child component, react js uses
custom events (create a function in parent and invoke it from child by passing data to parent function)
